# Scrum Glossary

## Scrum Pillars
### Transparency
Processes and work must be visible to all the people involved. This includes those who perform the work within the Scrum team and those who receive the work; the stakeholders. It enables inspection and inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.

---

### Inspection
The Scrum artifacts and progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems.  
Scrum provides a framework for inspection in form of its 5 events: **Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective**.

---

### Adaptation
If any part of the process strays beyond acceptable boundaries or the product does not meet standards, corrections need to happen quickly in form of adaption to prevent the situation from worsening.
Scrum Teams are expected to adapt immediately after inspection.

## Scrum Values
Successful Scrum depends on living five values:  
- **Commitment**: Achieving goals and supporting each other  
- **Focus**: Concentrating on the Sprint work  
- **Openness**: Being transparent about work and challenges  
- **Respect**: Valuing each other's capabilities and independence  
- **Courage**: Doing the right thing and tackling tough problems  

These values guide behavior and decision-making, reinforcing the Scrum pillars and building trust.

## Scrum Team
The fundamental Scrum unit, consisting of:  
- **Scrum Master**  
- **Product Owner**  
- **Developers**

Characteristics:  
- No sub-teams or hierarchies  
- Cross-functional (all skills needed to create value)  
- Self-managing (decide internally who does what, when, and how)  
- Typically up to 10 people to maintain nimbleness and productivity  
- Responsible for all product-related activities to achieve the Product Goal  
- Accountable for delivering a valuable Increment each Sprint 
- Scrum does not forbid roles from overlapping, but overlapping roles should be approached with caution

---

## Developers
Members committed to creating a usable Increment each Sprint. Accountabilities:  
- Plan the Sprint (Sprint Backlog)  
- Ensure quality via the Definition of Done  
- Adapt the plan daily toward the Sprint Goal  
- Hold each other accountable as professionals

---

## Product Owner
Accountable for maximizing product value and managing the Product Backlog, including:  
- Developing and communicating the Product Goal  
- Creating and ordering Product Backlog items  
- Ensuring backlog transparency and understanding  
- One person (not a committee), representing many stakeholders  
- Holds final authority on backlog changes

---

## Scrum Master

- Coaching self-management and cross-functionality

## Scrum Events

### Sprint

- Sprint may be cancelled only by the Product Owner

### Sprint Planning
- Defines Sprint work collaboratively  
- Topics:  
  1. Why is this Sprint valuable? (Sprint Goal)  
  2. What can be done this Sprint? (Backlog items selected)  
  3. How will the work get done? (Sprint Backlog plan)  
- Timeboxed to 8 hours (less for shorter Sprints)

### Daily Scrum
- 15-minute event for Developers  
- Inspect progress toward Sprint Goal and adapt plan  
- Held daily at the same time and place  
- Improves communication, identifies impediments, quick decision-making

### Sprint Review
- Inspect Sprint outcome and adapt Product Backlog  
- Collaboration between Scrum Team and stakeholders  
- Timeboxed to 4 hours (less for shorter Sprints)

### Sprint Retrospective

## Scrum Artifacts

### Product Backlog
- Emergent, ordered list of work to improve the product  
- Single source of work for Scrum Team  
- Items refined to be ready for Sprint Planning  
- Commitment: **Product Goal** – long-term objective guiding backlog items

### Sprint Backlog
- Composed of Sprint Goal (why), selected Product Backlog items (what), and plan (how)  
- Real-time visible plan updated throughout Sprint  
- Commitment: **Sprint Goal** – single Sprint objective providing focus and flexibility

### Increment
- Concrete stepping stone toward Product Goal  
- Must be usable and meet the Definition of Done  
- Sum of all Increments reviewed in Sprint Review  
- Commitment: **Definition of Done** – formal quality criteria for work completion

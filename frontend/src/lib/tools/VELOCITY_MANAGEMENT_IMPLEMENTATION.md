  - Performance pattern identification
  - Trend-based capacity recommendations
  - Historical performance insights

## Integration with Existing System

### Backend API Integration
- Leverages existing `/api/v1/velocity/*` endpoints
- Uses established velocity tracking service
- Integrates with automatic velocity calculation from completed backlog items
- Maintains consistency with frontend velocity displays

### Velocity Calculation
The system automatically calculates velocity based on:
- Completed user stories and bugs (epics excluded)
- Story points from items marked as "Done"
- Automatic updates when backlog items change status
- Real-time velocity tracking through burndown snapshots

### Authentication & Security
- Consistent cookie-based authentication with other tools
- Proper error handling for authentication failures
- Secure API calls with context forwarding

## Name Aliasing Support

All tools support various naming conventions:
- **Sprint ID**: `sprint_id`, `sprintId`, `id`
- **Project ID**: `project_id`, `projectId`
- **Exclude Sprint ID**: `exclude_sprint_id`, `excludeSprintId`

## Usage Examples

The Product Owner Agent can now handle velocity-related requests like:

### Sprint Velocity Queries
- *"What's the velocity of sprint 5?"*
- *"Show me the completed story points for the last sprint"*
- *"How many points did we deliver in sprint 3?"*

### Average Velocity & Capacity Planning
- *"What's our team's average velocity?"*
- *"Calculate average velocity excluding the current sprint"*
- *"What should our sprint capacity be based on historical data?"*
- *"Recommend sprint capacity for the next sprint"*

### Comprehensive Metrics
- *"Show me complete velocity metrics for this project"*
- *"What's our team's velocity consistency?"*
- *"Give me a full performance analysis"*

### Trend Analysis
- *"How has our velocity been trending?"*
- *"Show velocity trends for the last 5 sprints"*
- *"Is our team improving or declining in velocity?"*

## Capacity Planning Intelligence

### Data-Driven Recommendations
The tools provide intelligent capacity recommendations based on:

1. **Historical Performance**: Uses actual completed story points
2. **Velocity Consistency**: Adjusts recommendations based on team predictability
3. **Trend Analysis**: Considers recent performance patterns
4. **Performance Classification**: Provides context-aware suggestions

### Recommendation Categories
- **Conservative Planning**: 90% of average velocity for uncertain sprints
- **Standard Planning**: Average velocity with 10-20% variance
- **Aggressive Planning**: 110% of average for well-defined work

### Team Performance Classifications
- **High-performing team** (20+ avg velocity): Advanced capacity suggestions
- **Solid team** (12-19 avg velocity): Standard capacity planning
- **Developing team** (6-11 avg velocity): Growth-focused recommendations
- **Early-stage team** (<6 avg velocity): Conservative, skill-building approach

3. **Velocity Alerts**: Notify when velocity deviates significantly
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare velocity across different projects
5. **Velocity Decomposition**: Analyze velocity by story type or team member

## Testing Recommendations

To test the velocity management tools:
1. Test with projects that have completed sprints
2. Verify capacity recommendations align with team performance
3. Test trend analysis with various velocity patterns
4. Validate error handling with missing or invalid data
5. Confirm integration with sprint capacity planning workflows

## Key Metrics Tracked

The system tracks and analyzes:
- **Individual Sprint Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Average Velocity**: Mean performance across completed sprints  
- **Velocity Range**: Min and max velocity for consistency analysis
- **Velocity Trends**: Performance patterns over recent sprints
- **Total Delivery**: Cumulative story points across all sprints
- **Sprint Count**: Number of completed sprints for statistical validity

This comprehensive velocity management system enables Product Owners to make informed, data-driven decisions about sprint capacity planning while maintaining the flexibility to account for team dynamics and project complexity.
